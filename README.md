# hive-online
Hive Online is an online implementation of the board game [Hive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hive_(game)). It is similar to something like chess in that it is an abstract strategy board game with pieces that can move, but the main difference is that there's no board in Hive.

You can play the game online at https://anish-shanbhag.github.io/hive-online/.
